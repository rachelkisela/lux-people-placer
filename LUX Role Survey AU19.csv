INSTA: robinc_

Did a co-DP role for a short film that was being put into a sizzle reel being pitched to Netflix.
Done work as an extra on feature film set.
Lots of videos for high school
Comfortable with Premiere. Some experience in after effects and blender. Some experience in DaVinci Resolve for coloring

Still learning a lot. Sorta ok at a lot of roles. Hoping to expand skill set and learn a lot from the significantly more experienced  at LUX.

DP might be too ambitious for me on a first project for LUX but at the same time I see it as a fun challenge.

I’m really excited to join the club. Can’t wait for the first production!
