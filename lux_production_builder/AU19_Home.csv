I have experience with DSLRs and also the URSA cinematic cameras. I also have editing experience, with Final Cut and Premiere."

"Camera Operator","suh3@uw.edu","Helen Su",2,2,"No","","Home","Pumpkin Spice","Pseudonym","Camera Operator","Assistant Camera Operator","Art Department","Production","I've been doing acting for 7-8 years now, mainly in school plays. I took Drama 251 and 252 last school year (freshmen year). I also took Drama 406 at UW, which gave me the basics of filmmaking. I have directed and edited some videos before, but have much to learn, especially regarding the actual shooting process. I especially want to learn more about camera shots -- how to use framing, angles, etc, to most effectively (and beautifully) get the story across. I would like to work in the LUX production ""Home"" because I am passionate about the theme of figuring out what is 'home,' especially since I have struggled with this idea as an Asian American growing up with immigrant parents. Here is one of my videos: https://youtu.be/KeE-zLbCo9A "

"Production Assistant.6","vmitch@uw.edu","Viola Mitchell",1,1,"No","","Pseudonym","Life on Earth","Pumpkin Spice","Camera Operator","Producer","Script Supervisor","Production","Hi! Unfortunately I have conflicts nov 2/3 and nov 23/24, but other than that I am very flexible.
Experience: I took a film class last year and created ~7 3-8 minute films (only a few of which were any good). I also have done a bunch of photography and theatre. I have experience filming using Nikon DSLRs, go-pros, DJI pocket cameras, and iPhones. I’ve edited primarily with iMovie (and using Lightroom to color grade) but I’ve been trying to get used to using DaVinci Resolve. 
Goals: I would love to learn more about the overall process of creating a film as a team, and I’m super flexible with doing any job. I’m big into aesthetics (specifically color grading) and I’m also a big photography nut (cinematography seems really interesting but kinda intimidating)– but I’ll truly do anything!
I’m here to have a good time, learn a lot, and create some nice short films!"

- Tuesdays and Thursdays at 6-7 PM: Development class for The Daily
