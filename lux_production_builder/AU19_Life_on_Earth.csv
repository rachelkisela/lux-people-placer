I don't have a ton of film experience but I'm very eager to learn more, and I'm also extremely organized and reliable. My ideal would be to help out with a variety of jobs and learn as I go. 
I have a fair amount of experience with theater, and I've done a few very short films on my own, figuring things out as I went along. I really like editing, but haven't done it enough to feel comfortable editing one of these projects.

Here's my first video project for my UW Certificate in Film & Video Production: https://vimeo.com/364972683

And here's a short Studio Tour art video I made for my mom: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g-7V2DOMng&list=PL8S3ym-YeI9CQU9tN_tqEK4e5Fjl1SJSp"

I have directed and edited a few short films and music videos in the past. I don't have access to any of my narrative films but I do have a YouTube channel with travel and festival movies:

But please don't judge my ability on all of them - some were made back when I only had iMovie (I did sell the Iceland one to a tour company though).
I won Best Cinematography 3 years in a row in high school and Best Film senior year. I was in the Top25 for a Discovery Channel internship photography/videography competition in 2018. "
