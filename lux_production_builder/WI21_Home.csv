I don't have a formal reel, but the video linked here (https://youtu.be/SMXRMo5bVB8) is one of my best works in my high school's video production class/club; I wrote, directed, acted in, shot, and edited most of it!"

"Camera Operator","suh3@uw.edu","Helen Su",2,2,"No","","Home","Pumpkin Spice","Pseudonym","Camera Operator","Assistant Camera Operator","Art Department","Production","I've been doing acting for 7-8 years now, mainly in school plays. I took Drama 251 and 252 last school year (freshmen year). I also took Drama 406 at UW, which gave me the basics of filmmaking. I have directed and edited some videos before, but have much to learn, especially regarding the actual shooting process. I especially want to learn more about camera shots -- how to use framing, angles, etc, to most effectively (and beautifully) get the story across. I would like to work in the LUX production ""Home"" because I am passionate about the theme of figuring out what is 'home,' especially since I have struggled with this idea as an Asian American growing up with immigrant parents. Here is one of my videos: https://youtu.be/KeE-zLbCo9A "
