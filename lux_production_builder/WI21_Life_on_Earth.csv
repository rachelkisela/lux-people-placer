INSTA: robinc_

Did a co-DP role for a short film that was being put into a sizzle reel being pitched to Netflix.
Done work as an extra on feature film set.
Lots of videos for high school
Comfortable with Premiere. Some experience in after effects and blender. Some experience in DaVinci Resolve for coloring

Still learning a lot. Sorta ok at a lot of roles. Hoping to expand skill set and learn a lot from the significantly more experienced  at LUX.

DP might be too ambitious for me on a first project for LUX but at the same time I see it as a fun challenge.

I’m really excited to join the club. Can’t wait for the first production!

I don't have a ton of film experience but I'm very eager to learn more, and I'm also extremely organized and reliable. My ideal would be to help out with a variety of jobs and learn as I go. 
I have a fair amount of experience with theater, and I've done a few very short films on my own, figuring things out as I went along. I really like editing, but haven't done it enough to feel comfortable editing one of these projects.

But please don't judge my ability on all of them - some were made back when I only had iMovie (I did sell the Iceland one to a tour company though).
I won Best Cinematography 3 years in a row in high school and Best Film senior year. I was in the Top25 for a Discovery Channel internship photography/videography competition in 2018. "
