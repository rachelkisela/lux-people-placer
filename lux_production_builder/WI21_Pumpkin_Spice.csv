The only major event that I cannot skip this quarter is for a club in which I have a leadership position. They are going to a conference on the weekend of November 23-24. Otherwise, I am happy to make time in my schedule for the production at any other time. I worked on lighting and script revisions for my brother's college application films. I've also had extensive editing background going back to 8th grade, wherein I made a mini-documentary as part of a history project. I am comfortable with Adobe Premiere Pro and can get access to it provided I am an editor. Here is a link to a school project, a short montage which I edited and sound designed (both alone) during my senior year of high school: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLRI5Z5g8Lo"
"Director of Photography","jdwini@uw.edu","Josh Winiarski",2,3,"No","","Pumpkin Spice","Pseudonym","Home","Director of Photography","Camera Operator","Editor","Production","- I really want to work with an experienced crew if possible. My goal for this quarter is to learn more than to lead, and while I would prefer to work as a DP or camera operator, I would be willing to do something else if it meant I could work on a more ambitious production. I want to try directing a film at some point this year, so I'm mostly interested in seeing how experienced members operate in different positions and learning from them.

- Uhhhh credentials? I've worked on 3 LUX films, and then I do social media stuff on YouTube and Instagram + freelance work.

P.S. If I happen to be an editor...I will likely NOT FINISH by the end of the quarter if it's finals week and someone hands me a ton of footage. Totally willing to put my soul into an edit over break, or if i'm given a bunch of notice beforehand though!"

Unfortunately I have conflicts nov 2/3 and nov 23/24, but other than that I am very flexible. Also I won't be at the club meeting next week :(  but I check my email frequently!
Experience: I took a film class last year and created ~7 3-8 minute films (only a few of which were any good). I also have done a bunch of photography and theatre. I have experience filming using Nikon DSLRs, go-pros, DJI pocket cameras, and iPhones. I’ve edited primarily with iMovie (and using Lightroom to color grade) but I’ve been trying to get used to using DaVinci Resolve. 
Goals: I would love to learn more about the overall process of creating a film as a team, and I’m super flexible with doing any job. I’m big into aesthetics (specifically color grading) and I’m also a big photography nut (cinematography seems really interesting but kinda intimidating)– but I’ll truly do anything!
I’m here to have a good time, learn a lot, and create some nice short films! I am hoping to direct films in the future, so basically any job that lines up with my strengths or with that would be awesome!"
