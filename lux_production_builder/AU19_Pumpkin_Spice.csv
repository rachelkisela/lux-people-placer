The only major event that I cannot skip this quarter is for a club in which I have a leadership position. They are going to a conference on the weekend of November 23-24. Otherwise, I am happy to make time in my schedule for the production at any other time. I worked on lighting and script revisions for my brother's college application films. I've also had extensive editing background going back to 8th grade, wherein I made a mini-documentary as part of a history project. I am comfortable with Adobe Premiere Pro and can get access to it provided I am an editor. Here is a link to a school project, a short montage which I edited and sound designed (both alone) during my senior year of high school: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLRI5Z5g8Lo"
"Director of Photography","jdwini@uw.edu","Josh Winiarski",2,3,"No","","Pumpkin Spice","Pseudonym","Home","Director of Photography","Camera Operator","Editor","Production","- I really want to work with an experienced crew if possible. My goal for this quarter is to learn more than to lead, and while I would prefer to work as a DP or camera operator, I would be willing to do something else if it meant I could work on a more ambitious production. I want to try directing a film at some point this year, so I'm mostly interested in seeing how experienced members operate in different positions and learning from them.

- Uhhhh credentials? I've worked on 3 LUX films, and then I do social media stuff on YouTube and Instagram + freelance work.

P.S. If I happen to be an editor...I will likely NOT FINISH by the end of the quarter if it's finals week and someone hands me a ton of footage. Totally willing to put my soul into an edit over break, or if i'm given a bunch of notice beforehand though!"

INSTA: robinc_

Did a co-DP role for a short film that was being put into a sizzle reel being pitched to Netflix.
Done work as an extra on feature film set.
Lots of videos for high school
Comfortable with Premiere. Some experience in after effects and blender. Some experience in DaVinci Resolve for coloring

Still learning a lot. Sorta ok at a lot of roles. Hoping to expand skill set and learn a lot from the significantly more experienced  at LUX.

DP might be too ambitious for me on a first project for LUX but at the same time I see it as a fun challenge.

I’m really excited to join the club. Can’t wait for the first production!
